How to compile

Since I have made a makefile, you can just simply type “make” in the ubuntu terminal to compile all the c files.

How to Run

To Run simply type “./mssv <file name>  <delay>” where the file name is the name of the file that contains the solution of sudoku that needs to be validated, and delay is the number of seconds you can make all children threads sleep. I have included 2 text files with the same solution named “solution.txt” and “testtext.txt” (“testtext.txt” was used to test the program though now it contains the same solution as the “solution.txt”). For an example, the program could run with the prompts “./mssv solution.txt 1”.
